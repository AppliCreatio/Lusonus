# Lusonus
Lusonus comes from the latin words: Luso, meaning playing; and Sonus, meaning audio. 
Lusonus itself means playful, which is the energy we bring to the room with our app.

## Goal
Our goal is to make an all purpose media app that is both convienient, and intuitive to use.
Our app will be phone based, meaning we are giving you our best to make your mobile media _feel_ like it belongs.
